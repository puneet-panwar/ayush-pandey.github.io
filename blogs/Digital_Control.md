### Digital Control Systems


In this article, we will discuss the use of digital computers in the real-time control of dynamic systems.  
#### Why Digital Control ?   
- Increased flexibilty of selecting control algorithm.   
- one hardware design with many different software variations can be used for a range of products.   

Following image shows the block diagram of basic control system:
